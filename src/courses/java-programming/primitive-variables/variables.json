        "Variables can store many different types of values, including numbers, text, and booleans. They are not limited to performing mathematical operations.",
        "Correct! Variables in Java are used to store information and can hold different types of values.",
        "Variables can be used in some cases to control the flow of a program, but that is not their only use.",
        "Defining the structure of a class is done through class declarations, not variables."
