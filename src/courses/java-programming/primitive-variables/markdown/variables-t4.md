```java
VariableType variableName = variableValue;
```

`variableName` represents the name of the variable, so you can access it later. When you use this name in an expression, java fills in the value of the variable.

> Variables are named in a specific way in java, known as camel case. The first letter is always lowercase, and any following words start with an uppercase letter. If you don't name it correctly, it will still compile, but is considered bad practice.

You **_cannot_** include spaces in a variable name!
