```java
VariableType variableName = variableValue;
```

`variableName` represents the name of the variable, so you can access it later. When you use this name in an expression, java fills in the value of the variable.

> Variables are named in a specific way in java, known as camel case. The first letter is always lowercase, and any following words start with an uppercase letter. 

You ***cannot*** include spaces in a variable name!
