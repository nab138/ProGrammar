# Variables

Variables in java are split into two types: primitive and reference types. We'll focus on primitive types for now.

> Primtive types are stored on the stack, while reference types are stored on the heap.

There are several different primitive types, however the most common ones are integers, doubles, chars, and booleans.

> Protip! These boxes provide extra information that you **don't** always have to worry about understanding! They are just here to give additional info and introduce concepts which we'll go over later.
