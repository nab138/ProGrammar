# Variables

A variable in java is used to store information. They are similar to algebraic variables, with one key difference: they can store different types of values.

Variables can store text, numbers, booleans, and much, much more. You can think of variables like a box, that can store a value inside.

> Variables are broken up into two main catagories of types: primitive and reference.

There are several different primitive types, however the most common ones are integers, doubles, chars, and booleans.

> Protip! These boxes provide extra information that can help grow your knowledge. They are here to give additional info and introduce concepts which we will go over later.
