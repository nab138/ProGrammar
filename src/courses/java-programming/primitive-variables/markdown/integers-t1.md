# Integers

Integers are whole numbers, and can be negative or positive. They cannot contain decimals!

To delcare a variable as an integer, you write `int` as the type. Integers are considered a primitive variable in java, so their type is written in all lowercase. Integer is also shortened to "Int".

```java
int myInt = 5;
```
