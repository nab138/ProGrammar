```java
VariableType variableName = variableValue;
```

The `=` symbol is known as the assignment operator, and assigns your new variable a value.

`variableValue` represents the value you will initialize your variable with. It must be something of the type you declared you variable to be. For example, if you used type integer, you could assign it a value of 5, but not of "Hello, World!"
