To declare variables, you must this syntax:

```java
VariableType variableName = variableValue;
```

> In some cases, you don't want to give the variable a value immediatley. In that case, you can omit the equals sign.
>
> ```java
> VariableType variableName;
> ```

`VariableType` represents the type of the variable, telling java what kinds of values will be stored there.

`variableName` represents the name of the variable, so you can access it later. Notice the way it's written: No spaces, first letter lowercase, first letter of all other words uppercase.

The `=` symbol is known as the assignment operator, and assigns your new variable a value.

`variableValue` represents the value you will initialize your variable with. It must be something of the type you declared you variable to be.
