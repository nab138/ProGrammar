They are similar to algebraic variables, with one key difference: they can store different types of values.\n\nVariables can store text, numbers, booleans, and much, much more. You can think of variables like a box, that can store a value inside.\n\n> Variables are broken up into two main catagories of types: primitive and reference.\n\nThere are several different primitive types, however the most common ones are integers, doubles, chars, and booleans.\n\n> Protip! These boxes provide extra information that can help grow your knowledge.
